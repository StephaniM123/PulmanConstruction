      and accommodating and the jobs he has done for us have been of a different
      standard to any other carpenter.<br />

    <p>Anthony and his team worked very efficiently throughout the process and took lots of time and effort
    to help ensure the end result was what I wanted. There were extra works that needed to be carried outputsuch as full rewire
  and they still made sure they kept as close to the original time frame as possible.<br />
I would highly recommend this company. <em>Complete flat refurbishement including full rewire, wall removal and new
